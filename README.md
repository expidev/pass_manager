# Overview

This app is my first attempt at building a mobile app using React Native. My goal is to take the first step in the mobile development and have a good grasp on CRUD operations, state management, and navigation in a mobile environment. I am also looking to improve my skills in JavaScript and familiarize myself with the React Native framework.

My app is called "Password managers" which is used to store all your passwords in different platform. It only allows to create your stored password, and remove it. The main page will list all of your inputs in a format [platform - key] then [memo - password]. When we open the app, it asks you to enter a pin code, or create a new one if you don't have it. After entering the pin code, you can see the main page. You can renew the pin code in the setting page as well.
